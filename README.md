# PeopleSoft
Utilities to create and maintain PeopleSoft databases on Oracle/Linux.

These python scripts are designed as wrappers to creating, backing up and restoring PeopleSoft pluggable databases on Multi-Tenant Oracle 12cR2 and later.  For the most part, you can change the valies in the global_vars.py script and then use the scripts as is.  The command line options are shared/common to all scripts.  However, not all command line options have meaning to each script.  Some command line options will simply be ignored if the option has no meaning to that script.

Eventually I will add more details about the setup and use case.  For now... i just want to get the files posted.
